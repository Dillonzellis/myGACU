                <p class="innercontent"><strong>VISA. </strong>In this Agreement the words &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Your&quot; means the member or members to whom a Card or Cards are issued, or who have agreed to pay the obligations arising from the use of a Card issued to another person. The words &quot;We&quot; &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;Our&quot; mean MyGeorgia Credit Union. Card means any VISA Card(s) subject to this Agreement issued to you by us, or other single credit device being used from time to time upon presentation to obtain money, property, labor or services on credit. &quot;Card&quot; is implied when you obtain credit by using your account number without using the Card.<br />
                  <strong>TERMS AND  CONDITIONS. </strong>Your VISA Card may not be used for any illegal transaction. Such use may subject you to criminal penalties and will result in your VISA account privileges being terminated. NO CHARGES OR DEBITS INCURRED FOR GAMBLING TRANSACTIONS WILL BE KNOWINGLY HONORED BY THE CREDIT UNION and it shall be our policy to attempt to block all such transactions.<br />
                  <strong>PURCHASES and Cash  Advances.</strong> You can use the Card for Purchases and Cash Advances. You will owe us for these amounts plus interest and other charges, if any, all payable in United States Dollars. Conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure payment of credit extended under the account.<br />
  <strong>(1)VISA Classic  Secured.</strong>If your Card account is secured, as a condition of approval for your account you grant us a specific pledge in your Credit Union shares (deposits) and checking account(s) except in those accounts that would have adverse tax consequences if pledged as security. You agree that your pledged amount equals your credit limit and such amounts are pledged as security for your account. We may, but do not have to allow you to withdraw a portion of your shares without affecting our security interest.<br />
  <strong>(2) VISA Platinum,  VISA Classic.</strong> Your Card account is secured by the statutory  lien on shares granted by the Federal Credit Union Act. Further, <strong>you  pledge and grant a security interest in all individual and joint accounts you  have with us now and in the future to secure you Card account. You authorize us to apply the balance in  these account(s) to pay any amounts due under this Agreement if you should default.</strong><br />
  <strong>(3) </strong>You grant us a purchase money security interest in any goods you purchase through the account. Property securing other loans with us now and in the future may also secure this account, except that you do not convey to us any security interest in your dwelling by incurring debts or credit under this Agreement.<br>
  <strong>Monthly Statement. </strong>If you have an outstanding debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00 or if there is any interest imposed during a billing cycle, we will send you a statement. You must pay us (or if we elect, to any party to whom we transfer and assign your account) according to the terms and conditions of the account.<br>
  <strong>Conditions under  which you will be charged Interest.</strong><br />
  <strong>(1) Purchases. </strong>Interest will accrue from the date posted on transactions for purchases posted during a billing cycle when there is a previous balance and it is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the billing cycle. Interest that will accrue from the first day of the next billing cycle will also be imposed on purchases included in the new balance when the entire new balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date.<br />
  <strong>(2) Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. </strong>Interest is computed on a periodic rate basis will be imposed on cash advances from the date posted to the account to the date paid. Interest accrued on cash advances between the closing date of the billing cycle and the date your account is credited will appear on your next statement. There is no time period to avoid paying interest.<br />
  <strong>(3)</strong> If your account is subject to interest  charges, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay, the less your  interest charges will be.<br />
  <strong>The Method of  determining the balance upon which interest will be charged.</strong><br />
  <strong>(1) </strong>We calculate the interest on cash advances by applying a periodic rate to the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of cash advances on your account (including current transactions for cash advances). To determine the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of cash advances we begin with the previous day's ending principal cash advance balance (fees not included). To this balance for each day in the billing period, we add new cash advances, new balance transfers, other debit transactions; then<br>
  subtract any principal payments or credits. The sum of the ending daily balances for the billing period is then divided by the number of days in the billing period. The result is the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of cash advances.<br />
  <strong>(2) </strong>We calculate the interest on purchases by applying a periodic rate to the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of purchases on your account (including current transactions for purchases). To determine the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of purchases we begin with the previous day's ending principal purchase balance (fees not included). To this balance, for each day in the billing period we add new purchases and other debit transactions; then subtract any principal payments or credits. The sum of the ending daily balances for the billing period is then divided by the number of days in the billing period. The result is the &quot;Average Daily<br>
  Balance&quot; of purchases. If the entire previous balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the billing period, the &quot;Average Daily Balance&quot; of purchases will be considered $0.<br />
  <strong>The amount of  Interest imposed during a billing cycle will be determined by.</strong><br />
  <strong>(1) </strong>Multiplying the &ldquo;Average Daily Balance&rdquo; of  Cash Advances by the monthly periodic rate for Cash Advances; the corresponding  Annual Percentage Rate is determined by multiplying the monthly periodic rate  by 12.<br />
  <strong>(2)</strong> Multiplying the &ldquo;Average Daily Balance&rdquo; of  Purchases by the monthly periodic rate for Purchases; the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate is  determined by multiplying the monthly periodic rate by 12.<br />
  <strong>(3)</strong> Adding the result of item (1) and (2).<br />
  <strong>(4) Annual Percentage Rates (APR) </strong>and corresponding  Monthly Periodic Rates used to calculate interest are:<br />
                  a. VISA Platinum -7.9% APR; Monthly Periodic Rate .6583%<br />
                  b. VISA Classic Secured -15.00% APR; Monthly Periodic Rate 1.250%<br />
                  c. VISA Classic -12.00% APR; Monthly Periodic Rate 1.000%</p>
                <p class="innercontent"><strong>Conditions under  which any Other charges may be imposed.</strong><br />
                  <strong>(1)</strong> Late Payment. If your  payment is received ten (10) days after the payment due date, you  will be charged a late fee of $25.00<br />
                  <strong>(2)</strong> Balance Transfers Fee - None.<br />
                  <strong>(3)</strong> Cash Advance Fee - $2.00 (no interest rate  differential)<br />
                  <strong>(4)</strong> Account Cancellation Fee - $20.00 (if member  request to close VISA Secured, funds are not released for 14 days after receiving  request. A fee will be assessed if the  account has been in place for less than 6 months at the time of cancellation)<br />
                  <strong>Minimum Periodic  Payment Required. </strong>If you do not elect to pay your balance in full, you must pay at least the minimum payment due each month by the end of the billing cycle. The minimum payment will be the greater of 4% of your total new balance, or $25.00 plus any portion of the minimum payment(s) shown on prior statements which remain unpaid plus any amounts that exceed your credit limit. Payments are due on the 15th of every month.<br />
                  <strong>Application of  Payments.</strong> Payments when paid during a billing cycle will be applied to amounts outstanding at the time payment is received in the following order: Unpaid interest, other charges, previous cash advances, balance transfers and current cash advances, previous purchases and then to current purchases. Payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment will be applied first to balances with the highest Annual Percentage Rate until that balance is paid off and then to balances with the next highest Annual Percentage Rate until those balances are paid off. <strong><br>
